# Define data type
# Primitive data type
# Immutable data type

'''
  ->Datatype are those who gives identity to the data whether they are integer ,float,complex,string etc.
  ->Primitive data type are those datatypes which are already created by the software
  -> those datatype which can't be changed once it is created.
'''

# Numbers
# Classification of numbers in python
'''
   ->Numbers are immutable    for eg tuple int float
   ->Numbers can be classified into 3 types : integer,float ,complex

'''

# Integer
# Float
# Complex

'''
  -> Any number which doesn't have decimal point . for eg 5,6,7
  -> Float are the number which have the decimal point for eg 5.50 ,6.20 etc
  -> complex are the number which contain the imaginary part .for eg 5+2j, 3+2j etc
'''

# Setting the data type
# x = 20
# x = 20.5
# x = 1j


'''
    ->integer
    ->float
    ->complex
'''

# Casting
# x = int(20)
# x = float(20.5)
# x = complex(1j)


'''
      ->20  #integer
      ->20.5 #float
      ->0+1j  #complex
'''

# Type Conversion
# x = float(1)
# y = int(2.8)
# z = complex(1)


'''
    ->1.00 #float
    ->2   #int
    ->1j  #complex

'''

# Get the type
# print(type(1))
# print(type(2.8))
# print(type(1))
